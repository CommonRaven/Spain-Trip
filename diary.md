### Day 01 - 27/09/'16
*Tel-Aviv &rarr; Madrid*

* Flight arrived at madrid area too early, so plane circeled around Cuenca. -_-
* Arrived at the apartment (not too small, well equipped kitchen, nice bedrooms) near city center just before midnight, 
* Listened to Vicky Christina Barcelona OST to get in the mood, had a snack, went to sleep. :)
* Amendment: Also banged head real hard against an open window. Bleeded a bit, to really set the mood.

### Day 02 - 28/09/'16
*Madrid*

Woke up long before the alarm clock.
We had coffee at home and left at around 10:00 towards the `Prado Museum`.
On the way over, we stopped for another coffee alongside with Churros & Porros(?).
At the museum we only had the time to view important painters. A few new findings of note:
* Ribera's head of Bacchus
* Velasquez, las maninas, look for dog paintings by him
* Velázquez,  `The Buffon Don Juan de Austria`
* Velázquez, `Pablo de Valladolid`
* Velázquez, `The Buffon Barbarroja Don Cristóbal de Castaneda y Pernia`
* Velázquez, `Angus Dei` will be a great birthday gift for dad.
* Rubens `The Birth of The Milky Way` (ROFL, WTF)
* Goya `The Colossus`
* Goya `The Drowning Dog`

After several hours we left the museum for lunch at `Estado Puro` which I rule as a tourist trap, and had a great, but small and expansive, lunch, including `Jamon Iberico` and `Patatas Bravas`.

Later on, we walked almost all the way to Teatro Real. on the way we met tens of Bayren Munich FC fans singing loudly, and preaparing the mood towards the game vs. Atletico Madrid later that day, and after that had Sangria and my first spanish Geocache at `Plaza Mayor`. We then went through the `San Miguel Market` which is extremely touristic and superficial, Madrid's Sarona market. the building is a delight though.

Ilai & I split from my parents who then took a cab back home, and went to visit the `Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía`. The musem is brilliantly curated to.lead even an unexperienced viewer in a coherent and evolving path. We enjoyed it very much, and had the pleasure of observing original Dali pieces, multiple Picasso including the `Guernica`, and Man Ray's `Indestructible Object`.

After the visit, we walked back to the Apartment, to find a dinner including local vegetables, Manchego cheese, Jamon, Mortadella, and fresh bread & butter.

We played music and prepared for tomorrow.

* `17.75km` walked (24K Steps!)
* `1` Geocache Found
* `2` Jamon servings gone
* `1-0` Atletico-Bayren =/
