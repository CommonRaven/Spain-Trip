### Day 01 - 27/09/'16
*Tel-Aviv &rarr; Madrid*

* Flight arrived at madrid area too early, so plane circeled around Cuenca. -_-
* Arrived at the apartment @ `Av. de la Albufera, 18` (not too small, well equipped kitchen, nice bedrooms) near city center just before midnight, 
* Listened to Vicky Christina Barcelona OST to get in the mood, had a snack, went to sleep. :)
* Amendment: Also banged head real hard against an open window. Bleeded a bit, to really set the mood.

### Day 02 - 28/09/'16
*Madrid*

Woke up long before the alarm clock.
We had coffee at home and left at around 10:00 towards the `Prado Museum`.
On the way over, we stopped for another coffee alongside with Churros & Porros(?).
At the museum we only had the time to view important painters. A few new findings of note:
* Ribera's head of Bacchus
* Velasquez, `Las Maninas`, look for dog paintings by him
* Velázquez,  `The Buffon Don Juan de Austria`
* Velázquez, `Pablo de Valladolid`
* Velázquez, `The Buffon Barbarroja Don Cristóbal de Castaneda y Pernia`
* Velázquez, `Angus Dei` will be a great birthday gift for dad.
* Rubens `The Birth of The Milky Way` (ROFL, WTF)
* Goya `The Colossus`(and other `Black Paintings`)
* Goya `The Drowning Dog`
* I find it interesting that so early they were very busy with dogs. Both Velázquez and Goya have great and interesting portrayals of dogs.

After several hours we left the museum for lunch at `Estado Puro` which I rule as a tourist trap, and had a great, but small and expensive, lunch, including `Jamon Iberico` and `Patatas Bravas`.

Later on, we walked almost all the way to `Teatro Real`. on the way we met tens of Bayren Munich FC fans singing loudly, and preaparing the mood towards the game vs. Atletico Madrid later that day, and after that had Sangria and my first spanish Geocache at `Plaza Mayor`. We then went through the `San Miguel Market` which is extremely touristic and superficial, Madrid's Sarona market. the building is a delight though.

Ilai & I split from my parents who then took a cab back home, and went to visit the `Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía`. The musem is brilliantly curated to.lead even an unexperienced viewer in a coherent and evolving path. We enjoyed it very much, and had the pleasure of observing original Dali pieces, multiple Picasso including the `Guernica`, and Man Ray's `Indestructible Object`, which I always imagined was tiny, but is the size of me.

After the visit, we walked back to the Apartment, to find a dinner including local vegetables (oh, such tomatoez!), Manchego cheese, Jamon, Mortadella, and fresh bread & butter, and a bottle of Ribera del Duero (which was,a great Tempranillo for just 7.5€) was airing on the table.

We played music, had a terrible dessert named `Turron` and planned the next day.
The desert had 4 variants, one of which was a bad Marzipan (which is odd, it should be better, as we are near Toledo), the second had the taste of crude oil and the texture of dust, and the third had the texture of glass shards and the taste of nothing. I didn't bother with the last.

* `17.75km` walked (24K Steps!)
* `1` Geocache Found
* `2` Jamon servings gone
* `1-0` Atletico-Bayren =/


### Day 03 - 29/09/'16
*Madrid*

After getting up we took a cab to the `Niño Jesús` gate of the `Retiro Park`; by coincidence the driver's name was Jesús.<br>
We walked through the rose garden to the `Palacio de Cristal` (The Crystal Palace), a 19th century construction, consisting only of metal and glass. Inside, there was an odd pendulum like exhibit, which instead of drawing lines in sand, was dropping sand to draw. It was not well executed.

We continued to seek a Geocache by the pond, which we failed to find, and we went to the second, larger, pond to get some coffee and Churros by the water. A band was playing perfect Jazz, and tourists were hiring boats. The scene looked a little like a petri dish for tourists, as the pond is very small, and there's no point in rowing 50 meters and back.

We continued to `Calle Gran Vía`, where we had lunch at a place named `100 Montaditos`, which serves a 100 different kinds of bite-sized sandwiches, along with bacon+cheese french fries and Sangria, all for very cheap (~35€ for a meal that held 4 persons until dinner).

We kept walkingthe Gran Vía all the way to `Plaza de España`, where we split (Mom went to the Reina Sofía, which she missed the day before, and Ilai & dad continued to the apartment).

After visiting `Templo de Debod` (Temple of Debod), a monument brougt from Egypt and rebuild on an elevated surface just off the center of Madrid, and walking by `Museo Cerralbo` and the impressive `Palacio Real de Madrid` (Royal Palace of Madrid), I found 3 geocaches. For one that I didn't find, a comment mentioned getting help from a waiter at a nearby restaurant. After some amount of search, I asked a waiter, who somehow inferred I had no money and was hungry, and will have brougt me food have I not stopped him. Either he had no idea what a GC was, or he lied when he answered yes to my question 'do you speak English?'.

I returned without using a map by walking an unknown way, mostly through very small streets and quiet alleys, and nice areas which are off the touristic center. I enjoyed a cold drink and a cigarette in one of tge gardens on the way, and arrived at the apartment near 7pm for a shower and some rest.

* `13.5km` walked
* `3` Geocaches found
* `7` Different sandwiches eaten
