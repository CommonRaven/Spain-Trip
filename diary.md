## Day 01 - 27/09/'16
*Tel-Aviv &rarr; Madrid*

* Flight (which was hell, but aren't all flights?) arrived at madrid area too early, so plane circeled around Cuenca. -_-
* Arrived at the apartment @ `Av. de la Albufera, 18` (not too small, well equipped kitchen, nice bedrooms) near city center just before midnight, 
* Listened to Vicky Christina Barcelona OST to get in the mood, had a snack, went to sleep. :)
* Amendment: Also banged head real hard against an open window. Bleeded a bit, to really set the mood.

## Day 02 - 28/09/'16
*Madrid*

Woke up long before the alarm clock.
We had coffee at home and left at around 10:00 towards the `Prado Museum`.
On the way over, we stopped for another coffee alongside with Churros & Porros(?).
At the museum we only had the time to view important painters. A few new findings of note:
* Ribera's head of Bacchus
* Velasquez, `Las Maninas`, look for dog paintings by him
* Velázquez,  `The Buffon Don Juan de Austria`
* Velázquez, `Pablo de Valladolid`
* Velázquez, `The Buffon Barbarroja Don Cristóbal de Castaneda y Pernia`
* Velázquez, `Angus Dei` will be a great birthday gift for dad.
* Rubens `The Birth of The Milky Way` (ROFL, WTF)
* Goya `The Colossus`(and other `Black Paintings`)
* Goya `The Drowning Dog`
* I find it interesting that so early they were very busy with dogs. Both Velázquez and Goya have great and interesting portrayals of dogs.

After several hours we left the museum for lunch at `Estado Puro` which I rule as a tourist trap, and had a great, but small and expensive, lunch, including `Jamon Iberico` and `Patatas Bravas`.

Later on, we walked almost all the way to `Teatro Real`. on the way we met tens of Bayren Munich FC fans singing loudly, and preaparing the mood towards the game vs. Atletico Madrid later that day, and after that had Sangria and my first spanish Geocache at `Plaza Mayor`. We then went through the `San Miguel Market` which is extremely touristic and superficial, Madrid's Sarona market. the building is a delight though.

Ilai & I split from my parents who then took a cab back home, and went to visit the `Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía`. The musem is brilliantly curated to.lead even an unexperienced viewer in a coherent and evolving path. We enjoyed it very much, and had the pleasure of observing original Dali pieces, multiple Picasso including the `Guernica`, and Man Ray's `Indestructible Object`, which I always imagined was tiny, but is the size of me.

After the visit, we walked back to the Apartment, to find a dinner including local vegetables (oh, such tomatoez!), Manchego cheese, Jamon, Mortadella, and fresh bread & butter, and a bottle of Ribera del Duero (which was,a great Tempranillo for just 7.5€) was airing on the table.

We played music, had a terrible dessert named `Turron` and planned the next day.
The desert had 4 variants, one of which was a bad Marzipan (which is odd, it should be better, as we are near Toledo), the second had the taste of crude oil and the texture of dust, and the third had the texture of glass shards and the taste of nothing. I didn't bother with the last.

* `17.75km` walked (24K Steps!)
* `1` Geocache Found
* `2` Jamon servings gone
* `1-0` Atletico-Bayren =/


## Day 03 - 29/09/'16
*Madrid*

After getting up we took a cab to the `Niño Jesús` gate of the `Retiro Park`; by coincidence the driver's name was Jesús.<br>
We walked through the rose garden to the `Palacio de Cristal` (The Crystal Palace), a 19th century construction, consisting only of metal and glass. Inside, there was an odd pendulum like exhibit, which instead of drawing lines in sand, was dropping sand to draw. It was not well executed.

We continued to seek a Geocache by the pond, which we failed to find, and we went to the second, larger, pond to get some coffee and Churros by the water. A band was playing perfect Jazz, and tourists were hiring boats. The scene looked a little like a petri dish for tourists, as the pond is very small, and there's no point in rowing 50 meters and back.

We continued to `Calle Gran Vía`, where we had lunch at a place named `100 Montaditos`, which serves a 100 different kinds of bite-sized sandwiches, along with bacon+cheese french fries and Sangria, all for very cheap (~35€ for a meal that held 4 persons until dinner).

<i>100 Montaditos</i></p>

We kept walkingthe Gran Vía all the way to `Plaza de España`, where we split (Mom went to the Reina Sofía, which she missed the day before, and Ilai & dad continued to the apartment).

After visiting `Templo de Debod` (Temple of Debod), a monument brougt from Egypt and rebuild on an elevated surface just off the center of Madrid, and walking by `Museo Cerralbo` and the impressive `Palacio Real de Madrid` (Royal Palace of Madrid), I found 3 geocaches. For one that I didn't find, a comment mentioned getting help from a waiter at a nearby restaurant. After some amount of search, I asked a waiter, who somehow inferred I had no money and was hungry, and will have brougt me food have I not stopped him. Either he had no idea what a GC was, or he lied when he answered yes to my question 'do you speak English?'.

I returned without using a map by walking an unknown way, mostly through very small streets and quiet alleys, and nice areas which are off the touristic center. I enjoyed a cold drink and a cigarette in one of tge gardens on the way, and arrived at the apartment near 7pm for a shower and some rest.

### Flamenco

At 9pm we were set at our table for dinner and a show of the traditional Flamenco dance. It was a fantastic night.

The waitress asked for our orders straight at the beginnig, for the whole evening. 3-course meal:
* First course: Vegetable cream, egg and porccini mushroom, or a salad.
* Main course: Fish without sauce, fish in green sauce, or meatballs in red sauce.
* Last course: Lemon ice cream or cheese cake.
* Drinks.

All 3 firsts were very fresh and had rich and distinct taste. The main courses were like nothing I have had, with the fish in green sauce being some sort of a white-asparagus and butter sauce. The fish was fried perfectly, and the sauce was perfect. House wine was served as well, `Cuatro Gotas` simple, sweet, and mello in taste. Most orobably a Tempranillo.

When the meal was over, the show began. Dad took care to order at a place that isn't touristic and we were the only non-spanish at the `Taberna Flamenca "El Cortijo"` ("The Corridor").

The Taverna was a long room, with tiny tables, and a simple design, underground, and the entrance was at the back of a building one a side-street. Aside from us, only 3 more tables were taken in the room, as this was a weekday. Luckily, we ordered early, so we were the nearest to the stage.

The show was very intimate, and took place on a relatively small stage. Guitarist's hands were unbelievebly moving in ways many rockstars can only dream of achieveing.

The singer was terrific, reaching total accuracy in his voice, and I wish I could understand the stories told.

Two dancers were at the stage. The older, a thick, tall, blonde, with east european looks and severe face, seemed to be the owner or superior. The second dancer was a tall, extremely thin, almost arab-looking girl.

Interestingly, clapping or otherwise joining the band at rythm was forbidden, as this may interfere with the dancers' accuracy. It was that intimate.

Both dancers gave a performance I will not even try to describe. The intense, energetic movement, yet with total accuracy, was impaccable.

The older of the dancers gave me a flower during the dance, which I will remember for a long while.

We walked back home very excited, and very satisfied.

* `14.6km` walked
* `3` Geocaches found
* `7` Different sandwiches eaten
* `1` Flower received

## Day 04 - 30/09/'16
*Madrid &rarr; Toledo &rarr; Ávila*

We woke up early to finish preparations for the start of our journey to Barcelona. Dad and I went to the `Atocha`, Madrid's central station, to pick up our rented car (a Peugeot 3008), and returned to pick up Ilai & mom
from the hotel.

We left Madrid south to `Toledo`. Driving in Spain is a delight. Roads are in great shape, directins are everywhere, and driving culture seems very polite, and according to laws.

When we arrived, we parked right under the `Alcázar of Toledo`, an impressive stone fort located in the highest part of Toledo, which was used as a Roman palace in the 3rd century, and had lunch at a restaurant named `Sancho y Panza`, while the place had pictures in it's menu, number one indicator of a tourist trap, I had a `Secreto Ibérico`, which was the best pork steak I have had in my life. Also, I have fonally had the long awaited `Pimientos de Padrón`, a dish of small, deep fried spanish peppers, which isn't found outside of spain (you can find Padrón peppers at Uzeria in Tel-Aviv, cooked differently).

We continued to a tour around Toledo, which took.us out of the city, to a popular photo spot, and when we returned we went to see the `Santa Iglesia Catedral Primada de Toledo`. The cathedral has Gothic and Bizantine motives, with multiple arcs, and pillars made from multiple thin lines, unlike greek and roman pillars which are usually thick and monolithic.

We bough Marzipan, as Toledo Marzipan is supposed to be one of the best in the world, and had coffe before we continued on our way.

The way to Ávila reminded all of us of the Galilee in Israel, and also of the islands of Greece. I guess mediterranian is mediterranian. At about half way, we saw a beautiful stripe of beach, and got off the road to find the place. We had to drive a dust-road, to arrive at a real piece of heaven. 

At an unnamed place, on the waters of `Embalse del Burguillo`, and nearest to `El Tiemblo` town, we found huge magmatic boulders near the water, and between them sand and clear water. We stayed to have something to eat, and enjoy the breeze.

At some point we noticed it started getting darker, and we got back on our way. From there it took just over half an hour to get to Ávila, and we got there just before sunset (which is relatively late here).

The city of Ávila is built with brown stone, and looks very old, even though when approacing, only modern buildings appear. At the highest point in the city, the `Catedral de Ávila` is clearly seen from every direction.

We circled the city and climbed uphill in order to enter the old part of it, which is surrounded by walls. Near it's center, we found our hostel.

After parking the car and a short rest, Ilai stayed in, and the rest of us went out for a tour.

A note about parking: parking is prepaid, but if you pay over hours, it's carried to the next day. This way we were able to pay enough for both the remaining half an hour of payed time today, and add more for tomorrow morning.
I don't know of any arrangement at home that is even slightly similar..

<i>Ávila Murallas (Town Walls)<br>(note the different stone at the top)</i></p>

We left the hotel to stroll outside of the old city, walking through `Plaza Zurraquín`, which was beautifully lit in a way that blended perfectly with the red sunset clouds above the Plaza's walls, and the cathedral. We walked outside the walls, and observed the different building styles of the Murallas (town walls), and different architecture styles inside and outside the walls. Older construction in Ávila, used dark, perhaps magmatic, stone, usually in very large, non-symmetrical pieces. With every building, it is clear how the stune changed gradually into lighter color stones, brought from farther away, and also the size of the bricks gets smaller, and they become smaller and more symmetrical.

The three of us had dinner at `La Bodeguita de San Segundo`. A Bodegas, is a place serving primarily wine, and in addition some food beside it. Though wine is the main focus, the different dishes ("Raciones") and half-dishes were terrific. Notable were fried sardines, in a sauce I was unable to recognise, with onion, red pepper, and perhaps Saffron; also, plain grilled green asparagus was brought to perfection, with fresh, home made mayo and garlic. It was so good, I left the,sauce aside, to be had with bread.

* `207km` traveled
* `11km` walked
* `750ml` of a truely unique wine had
* `1` piece of eden unlocked


## Day 05 - 01/10/'16
*Ávila &rarr;  Segovia &rarr; ???*

After our morning coffee in Ávila, we went for another tour of the city, looking for new views, and visiting sites which were closed the night before.

We walked to the Cathedral and there we split. Ilai & I climbed the wall for a view of the whole city, and then we scanned the old city to leave it without any cache not found.

We then got in the car, and drove to `Segovia`. While very known, Segovia is relatively small. it's main attraction is the best reserved `The Aqueduct of Segovia` is a Roman aqueduct and one of the most significant and best-preserved ancient monuments in the area. It is located in Spain and is the symbol of Segovia, as evidenced by its presence on the city's coat of arms.

As beautiful as the Aqueduct is, the reason we came to Segovia was our planned lunch at the `Mesón De Cándido` ("Cándido's Mansion"), which is more than a restaurant, as much as a major culinary establishment.

While all dishes excel and the place is considered an important culinary location, it's mainly known for it's `Cándido Style Segovia Suckling Pig Recipe`. As it sounds, this is a dish of a very young piglet cooked very simply. The recipe is available on the restaurant's website, and ingredients are only:
 
> 1 cochinillo (piglet) of 4 to 4,5 kg  
> 100g lard  
> Salt

But much more importantly, a ritual which takes place in the restaurant a few times a day shows the quality of the result, by proving the most important part of the recipe:

>  The piglet must be crunchy enough to be carved with the edge of a plate.

And indeed, the cooked pig is placed at the center of the room, and after a short explanation, is cut to serving sized pieces using a porccelain plate, which is then thrown on the floor, and is broken.

<i>A piglet right from the oven</i></p>

After lunch, we climbed Segovia's streets to the cathedral, also constructed in Gothic architecture. The streets of Segovia were very crowded, mostly with spanish tourists. And it seems.like the city takes pride in the region's wines, of the `Catilla y Leon` region, including the Ribera del Duero.

From there, we set the GPS to `Zaragoza`, almost a 4-hour drive, which we weren't certail we will complete.

After about an hour and a half we found ourselves far from the main roads, between beautiful hills, with a fort nearby, we found a tiny settlement, and stopped for coffee.

Apparently, even the most remote locations in spain, such as `San Esteban de Gormaz` have at least 3 things available (and more on that later):

* Coffee, 24/7
* A Geocache (or more than one)
* Tourist information

Mom can't hold herself from speaking to the rep at the tourist centers, and collecting a stack of maps and local attraction brouchures.

After a short break, a quick geocache, and a refreshment, we continued, driving for about two more hours, which got scarrier and scarrier.

Away from main cities and main roads, completely alone, only seeing other cars every long distances, it started to become tiring, and the sun began to set.

As it got darker, and we still had a long way to Zaragoza, we started checking every settlement for hotels, but each seemed more deserted and unpleasent than the previous.

At some point, we began seeing graffiti saying `Falangas Assassini`, which is a call for murder by the Falangas -  the most radical, fascist movrment is spain. Not very reassuring.

Completing long distances and finding nothing, we were able to merge back into the main way between Madrid And Zaragoza, we tried the next settlement, `Ariza`, which only had one hostel, not to be found, and felt like a ghost town.

With the help of Google maps, we continued to `Alhama de Aragón`, the nearest settlement, where we tried the recommended hotel, only to find it is way over budget.

We then started calling different hotels at the area, until one was willing to accept us.

While we though it was in the same settlement, in fact the drive took over 20 minutes, and it was scary and dangerous, driving on a completely dard car-width road, on mountinsides, crossing 1 car-width bridges over huge lakes.

After 20+ minutes of this intense drive, not knowing where,we are haded, tired and annoyed, we,arrived at `Hotel Balneario De La Virgen` ("Spa of the Virgin").

We were all amazed to find a heavenly spot on a river among the cliffs, with affordable, neat rooms, a spa, hot springs, and beautiful gardens.

The resort was built into the cliffside, with balconies dug into stone as small caves, and with the building merging into stone, and it's banner hung high on the cliff.

No cellular reception was available at the place, and nothing was to be found anywhrere around. The place seems to be a secret spot, only known to spanish, as no other tourists were around, and as the receptionist heard our story she said "oh, you probably don't have swimwear.."

Oh, we had our swimwear alright. We were all ecstatic, and extremely happy with the pleasent surprise, as we were prepared for the worst.

After a short walk around, and a beer and a ham sandwich at the cafeteria, we split to our rooms, exhausted.

I went outside to take a few photos, but the conditions were sub-optimal, and I returned to bed.

* `348km` traveled

* `1` more piece of eden found
