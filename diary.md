### Day 01 - 27/09/'16
#### Tel-Aviv &rarr; Madrid

* Arrived at the apartment (not too small, well equipped kitchen, nice bedrooms) near city center just before midnight, 
* Listened to Vicky Christina Barcelona OST to get in the mood, had a snack, went to sleep. :)
* Amendment: Also banged head real hard against an open window. Bleeded a bit, to really set the.mood.
