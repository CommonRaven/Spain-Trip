## Day 01 - 27/09/'16
*Tel-Aviv &rarr; Madrid*

* Flight (which was hell, but aren't all flights?) arrived at madrid area too early, so plane circeled around Cuenca. -_-
* Arrived at the apartment @ `Av. de la Albufera, 18` (not too small, well equipped kitchen, nice bedrooms) near city center just before midnight, 
* Listened to Vicky Christina Barcelona OST to get in the mood, had a snack, went to sleep. :)
* Amendment: Also banged head real hard against an open window. Bleeded a bit, to really set the mood.

## Day 02 - 28/09/'16
*Madrid*

Woke up long before the alarm clock.
We had coffee at home and left at around 10:00 towards the `Prado Museum`.
On the way over, we stopped for another coffee alongside with Churros & Porros(?).
At the museum, we only had the time to view a few talented painters. A few new findings of note:
* Ribera's head of Bacchus
* Velasquez, `Las Maninas`, look for dog paintings by him
* Velázquez,  `The Buffon Don Juan de Austria`
* Velázquez, `Pablo de Valladolid`
* Velázquez, `The Buffon Barbarroja Don Cristóbal de Castaneda y Pernia`
* Velázquez, `Angus Dei` will be a great birthday gift for dad.
* Rubens `The Birth of The Milky Way` (ROFL, WTF)
* Goya `The Colossus`(and other `Black Paintings`)
* Goya `The Drowning Dog`
* I find it interesting that so early they were very busy with dogs. Both Velázquez and Goya have excellent and exciting portrayals of dogs.

After several hours we left the museum for lunch at `Estado Puro` which I ruled as a tourist trap and had a great, but small and expensive, meal including `Jamon Iberico` and `Patatas Bravas`.

Later on, we walked almost all the way to `Teatro Real`. On the way, we met tens of `Bayern Munich FC` fans singing loudly and preparing the mood towards the game vs. Atletico Madrid later that day, and after that had Sangria and my first Spanish Geocache at `Plaza Mayor`. We then went through the `San Miguel Market` which is extremely touristic and superficial, Madrid's Sarona market. The building is a delight, though.

Ilai & I split from my parents who then took a cab back home, and went to visit the `Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía`. The museum is brilliantly curated to lead even an inexperienced viewer in a coherent and evolving path. We enjoyed it very much and had the pleasure of observing original Dali pieces, multiple Picasso including the `Guernica`, and Man Ray's `Indestructible Object`, which I always imagined was tiny, but is the size of me.

After the visit, we walked back to the Apartment, to find a dinner including local vegetables (oh, such tomatoes!), Manchego cheese, Jamon, Mortadella, and fresh bread & butter. To accompany that, dad brought a bottle of `Ribera del Duero` (which was a great Tempranillo for just 7.5€) was airing on the table.

We played music, had a *terrible* dessert named `Turron` and planned the next day. The dessert had four variants, one of which was a bad Marzipan (which is odd, it should be better, as we are near Toledo), the second had the taste of crude oil and the texture of dust, and the third had the texture of glass shards and the taste of nothing. I didn't bother with the last.

* `17.75km` walked (24K Steps!)
* `1` Geocache Found
* `2` Jamon servings gone
* `1-0` Atletico-Bayren =/


## Day 03 - 29/09/'16
*Madrid*

After getting up, we took a cab to the `Niño Jesús` gate of the `Retiro Park`; by coincidence the driver's name was Jesús.<br>
We walked through the rose garden to the `Palacio de Cristal` (The Crystal Palace), a 19th-century construction, consisting only of metal and glass. Inside, there was an odd pendulum-like exhibit, which instead of drawing lines in the sand, was dropping sand to draw. It was not well executed.

We continued to seek a Geocache by the pond, which we failed to find, and we went to the second, larger, pond to get some coffee and Churros by the water. A band was playing perfect Jazz, and tourists were hiring boats. The scene looked a little like a petri dish for tourists, as the pond is tiny, and there's no point in rowing a boat 50 meters and back.

We continued to `Calle Gran Vía`, where we had lunch at a place named `100 Montaditos`, which serves 100 different kinds of bite-sized sandwiches, along with bacon+cheese french fries and Sangria, all for very cheap (~35€ for a meal that held four persons until dinner).

<p align="center">

<i>100 Montaditos</i></p>

We kept walking the Gran Vía all the way to `Plaza de España`, where we split (Mom went to the Reina Sofía, which she missed the day before, and Ilai & dad continued to the apartment).

After visiting `Templo de Debod` (Temple of Debod), a monument brought from Egypt and rebuild on an elevated surface just off the center of Madrid, and walking by `Museo Cerralbo` and the impressive `Palacio Real de Madrid` (Royal Palace of Madrid), I found three geocaches. For one that I didn't find, a comment mentioned getting help from a waiter at a nearby restaurant. After some amount of search, I asked a waiter, who somehow inferred I had no money and was hungry, and will have brought me food have I not stopped him. Either he had no idea what a GC was, or he lied when he answered yes to my question 'do you speak English?'.

I returned without using a map by walking an unknown way, mostly through small streets and quiet alleys, and beautiful areas which are off the touristic center. I enjoyed a cold drink and a cigarette in one of the gardens on the way and arrived at the apartment near 7 pm for a shower and some rest.

### Flamenco

At 9 pm we were set at our table for dinner and a show of the traditional Flamenco dance. It was a fantastic night.

The waitress asked for our orders straight at the beginning, for the whole evening. 3-course meal:
* First course: Vegetable cream, egg, and porcini mushroom, or a salad.
* Main course: Fish without sauce, fish in green sauce, or meatballs in red sauce.
* Last course: Lemon ice cream or cheesecake.
* Drinks.

All three firsts were very fresh and had a delicious and distinct taste. The main courses were like nothing I have had, with the fish in green sauce being some white asparagus and butter sauce. The fish was fried perfectly, and the sauce was perfect. House wine was served as well, `Cuatro Gotas` simple, sweet, and mellow in taste. Most probably a Tempranillo.

When the meal was over, the show began. Dad took care to order at a place that isn't touristic, and we were the only non-Spanish at the `Taberna Flamenca "El Cortijo"` ("The Corridor").

The Taverna was a long room, with tiny tables, and simple design, underground, and the entrance was at the back of a building one a side-street. Aside from us, only three more tables were taken in the room, as this was a weekday. Luckily, we ordered early, so we were the nearest to the stage.

The show was very intimate and took place on a relatively small stage. Guitarist's hands were unbelievably moving in ways many rock stars can only dream of achieving.

The singer was terrific, reaching complete accuracy in his voice, and I wish I could understand the stories told.

Two dancers were at the stage. The older, a thick, tall, blonde, with East European looks and stern face, seemed to be the owner or superior. The second dancer was a tall, fragile, almost Arab-looking girl.

Interestingly, clapping or otherwise joining the band at rhythm was forbidden, as this may interfere with the dancers' accuracy. It was that intimate.

Both dancers gave a performance I will not even try to describe. The intense, energetic movement, yet with complete accuracy, was impeccable.

The older of the dancers gave me a flower during the dance, which I will remember for a long while.

We walked back home very excited, and very satisfied.

* `14.6km` walked
* `3` Geocaches found
* `7` Different sandwiches eaten
* `1` Flower received

## Day 04 - 30/09/'16
*Madrid &rarr; Toledo &rarr; Ávila*

We woke up early to finish preparations for the start of our journey to Barcelona. Dad and I went to the `Atocha`, Madrid's central station, to pick up our rented car (a Peugeot 3008), and returned to pick up Ilai & mom
from the hotel.

We left Madrid south to `Toledo`. Driving in Spain is a delight. Roads are in great shape, directions are everywhere, and driving culture seems very polite, and according to laws.

When we arrived, we parked right under the `Alcázar of Toledo`, an impressive stone fort located in the highest part of Toledo, which was used as a Roman palace in the 3rd century. We had lunch at a restaurant named `Sancho y Panza`, while the place had pictures in its menu, number one indicator of a tourist trap, I had a `Secreto Ibérico`, which was the best pork steak I have had in my life. Also, I have finally had the long awaited `Pimientos de Padrón`, a dish of small, deep-fried Spanish peppers, which isn't found outside of Spain (you can find Padrón peppers at Uzeria in Tel-Aviv, cooked differently).

We continued to a tour around Toledo, which took.us out of the city, to a favorite photo spot, and when we returned we went to see the `Santa Iglesia Catedral Primada de Toledo`. The cathedral has Gothic and Bizantine motives, with multiple arcs, and pillars made from multiple thin lines, unlike Greek and Roman pillars which are usually thick and monolithic.

We bought Marzipan, as Toledo Marzipan is supposed to be one of the best in the world, and had coffee before we continued on our way.

The way to Ávila reminded all of us of the Galilee in Israel, and also of the islands of Greece. I guess Mediterranean is Mediterranean. At about half way, we saw a beautiful stripe of the beach and got off the road to find the place. We had to drive a dust road, to arrive at a real piece of heaven. 

At an unnamed place, on the waters of `Embalse del Burguillo`, and nearest to `El Tiemblo` town, we found huge magmatic boulders near the water, and among them sand and clear water. We stayed to have something to eat, and enjoy the breeze.

At some point, we noticed it started getting darker, and we got back on our way. From there it took just over half an hour to get to Ávila, and we got there just before sunset (which is relatively late here).

The city of Ávila is built with brownstone, and looks ancient, even though when approaching, only modern buildings appear. At the highest point in the city, the `Catedral de Ávila` is clearly seen from every direction.

We circled the town and climbed uphill to enter the old part of it, which is surrounded by walls. Near its center, we found our hostel.

After parking the car and a short rest, Ilai stayed in, and the rest of us went out for a tour.

A note about parking: parking is prepaid, but if you pay over hours, it's carried to the next day. This way we were able to pay enough for both the remaining half an hour of paid time today, and add more for tomorrow morning.
I don't know of any arrangement at home that is even slightly similar..

<i>Ávila Murallas (Town Walls)<br>(note the different stone at the top)</i></p>

We left the hotel to stroll outside of the old city, walking through `Plaza Zurraquín`, which was beautifully lit in a way that blended perfectly with the red sunset clouds above the Plaza's walls, and the cathedral. We walked outside the walls and observed the different building styles of the Murallas (town walls), and different architecture styles inside and outside the walls. Older construction in Ávila, used dark, perhaps magmatic, stone, and usually large, non-symmetrical pieces. With every building, it is evident how the stone changed gradually into lighter color stones, brought from farther away, and also the size of the bricks gets smaller, and they become smaller and more symmetrical.

The three of us had dinner at `La Bodeguita de San Segundo`. A Bodegas is a place serving primarily wine and also some food beside it. Though wine is the primary focus, the different dishes ("Raciones") and half-dishes were terrific. Notable were fried sardines, in a sauce which I was unable to recognize, with onion, red pepper, and perhaps Saffron; also, plain grilled green asparagus was made to perfection, with fresh, homemade mayo and garlic. It was so good that I left the sauce aside to be had with bread.

* `207km` traveled
* `11km` walked
* `750ml` of a truly unique wine had
* `1` piece of Eden unlocked


## Day 05 - 01/10/'16 - A pleasant surprise
*Ávila &rarr;  Segovia &rarr; ???*

After our morning coffee in Ávila, we went for another tour of the city, looking for new views, and visiting sites which were closed the night before.

We walked to the Cathedral, and there we split. Ilai & I climbed the wall for a view of the whole city, and then we scanned the old town to leave it without any cache not found.

We then got in the car, and drove to `Segovia`. While very known, Segovia is relatively small. It's main attraction is the best reserved `The Aqueduct of Segovia` is a Roman aqueduct and one of the most significant and best-preserved ancient monuments in the area. It is located in Spain and is the symbol of Segovia, as evidenced by its presence on the city's coat of arms.

As beautiful as the Aqueduct is, the reason we came to Segovia was our planned lunch at the `Mesón De Cándido` ("Cándido's Mansion"), which is more than a restaurant, as much as a major culinary establishment.

While all dishes excel and the place is considered an important culinary location, it's mainly known for it's `Cándido Style Segovia Suckling Pig Recipe`. As it sounds, this is a dish of a very young piglet cooked very simply. The recipe is available on the restaurant's website, and ingredients are only:
 
> 1 cochinillo (piglet) of 4 to 4,5 kg  
> 100g lard  
> Salt

But much more importantly, a ritual which takes place in the restaurant a few times a day shows the quality of the result, by proving the most important part of the recipe:

>  The piglet must be crunchy enough to be carved with the edge of a plate.

And indeed, the cooked pig is placed at the center of the room, and after a short explanation is cut into serving sized pieces using a porcelain plate, which is then thrown on the floor, and is broken.

<i>A piglet right from the oven</i></p>

After lunch, we climbed Segovia's streets to the cathedral, also constructed in Gothic architecture. The streets of Segovia were very crowded, mostly with Spanish tourists. And it seems like the city takes pride in the region's wines, of the `Castilla y Leon` region, including the Ribera del Duero.

From there, we set the GPS to `Zaragoza`, almost a 4-hour drive, which we weren't certain we would complete.

After about an hour and a half we found ourselves far from the main roads, between beautiful hills, with a fort nearby, we found a tiny settlement and stopped for coffee.

Apparently, even the most remote locations in Spain, such as `San Esteban de Gormaz` have at least three things available (and more on that later):

* Coffee, 24/7
* A Geocache (or more than one)
* Tourist information

Mom can't hold herself from speaking to the rep at the tourist centers and collecting a stack of maps and local attraction brochures.

After a short break, a quick geocache, and a refreshment, we continued, driving for about two more hours, which got scarier and scarier.

Away from main cities and main roads, completely alone, only seeing other cars every long distances, it started to become tiring, and the sun began to set.

As it got darker, and we still had a long way to Zaragoza, we started checking every settlement for hotels, but each seemed more deserted and unpleasant than the previous.

At some point, we began seeing graffiti saying `Falangas Assassini`, which is a call for murder by the Falangas -  the most radical, fascist movement is Spain. Not very reassuring.

Completing long distances and finding nothing, we were able to merge back into the main way between Madrid And Zaragoza, we tried the next settlement, `Ariza`, which only had one hostel, not to be found, and felt like a ghost town.

With the help of Google maps, we continued to `Alhama de Aragón`, the nearest settlement, where we tried the recommended hotel, only to find it is way over budget.

We then started calling different hotels in the area, until one was willing to accept us.

While we though it was in the same settlement, in fact, the drive took over 20 minutes, and it was scary and dangerous, driving on a completely dark car-width road, on mountainsides, crossing one car-width bridges over huge lakes.

After 20+ minutes of this intense drive, not knowing where we are headed, tired and annoyed, we arrived at `Hotel Balneario De La Virgen` ("Spa of the Virgin").

We were all amazed to find a heavenly spot on a river among the cliffs, with affordable, neat rooms, a spa, hot springs, and beautiful gardens.

The resort is built into the cliffside, with balconies dug into stone as small caves, and with the building merging into stone, and it's banner hung high on the cliff.

No cellular reception was available at the place, and nothing was to be found anywhere around. The site seems to be a secret spot, only known to Spanish, as no other tourists were around, and as the receptionist heard our story, she said: "oh, you probably don't have swimwear.."

Oh, we had our swimwear alright. We were all ecstatic, and euphoric with the pleasant surprise, as we were prepared for the worst.

After a short walk around, and a beer and a ham sandwich at the cafeteria, we split to our rooms, exhausted.

I went outside to take a few photos, but the conditions were sub-optimal, and I returned to bed.

* `348km` traveled
* `8.3km` walked
* `6` Geocaches found
* `1` more piece of eden found

## Day 06 - 02/10/'16
*Ávila &rarr;  Segovia &rarr; Aínsa*

As we woke up, we went for breakfast at the hotel. The simple hall and meal made us feel like in a kibbutz dining room. Surrounded mostly by old Spanish man and women, we felt as if we didn't belong at the place.

Bad, American style coffee was served to the table, and the meal consisted of fruit, mortadella, and bread. We ate quickly and left for a short stroll, and a quick find. After packing, Ilai and I tried a second cache but did not succeed, as it required a UV light.

We drove directly to Zaragoza, only to find how happy we were not to have reached it the day before. The city is vast, and as we circled it from south to north, and entered from the north, it seemed that aside from the city center, it is ugly and boring. The whole city seems to consist of cheap, standard working class housing, with large square identical apartment blocks.

As we approached the city center, we saw the `Catedral-Basílica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Zaragoza` ("The Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar"), a Baroque style building, with nine chapels.  The Basilica admires Blessed Virgin Mary, under her title "Our Lady" of the Pillar praised as Mother of the Hispanic Peoples

The tradition of the shrine of El Pilar, as given by Our Lady in an apparition to Sister Mary Agreda and written about in The Mystical City of God, is that Our Lady was carried on a cloud by the angels to Zaragoza during the night.

This is hilarious, as no godly creature will visit this dirty, ugly place. But still, we were lucky enough to enjoy the end of Sunday's Mass.

We had coffee at the Plaza and left the city center to have lunch at a seafood tapas restaurant named TraGanTua Gran Taberna. The place was recommended to us, and indeed, everything was great, including a salad of unique tomatoes which only grow in the area and had a very distinct taste, and were served with only olive oil and salt, but for us were a fresh new taste.

From Zaragoza, we set sail to Aínsa. The road over, fastly climbing to the mountain area, was *breathtaking*! Huge, upright spikes of stone, endless trees greener than green and overall a beautiful way climbing high on the hillsides, and lowering back to the valley only to get to the next hill.

Near Aínsa, Ilai spotted a Geocache on the map which had an enormous amount of favorite points, and we were hoping to find it, but the area of the cache was blocked bt construction works just offroad, and we were unable to get to the spot; still, the cache spot was a beautiful one, at the merge point of two rivers lust between 3 mountains.

We reached Aínsa, to find a new city low and near the river crossing it, and on top of it, uphill, the old town, made of brown brick, with small buildings. The floor was made of stone, but in an odd style where each stone was far from the ones near it and had a gap. This made walking harder and quickly also painful on the muscles, and made pulling a trolly impossible.

The city is in Aragon region, with a fantastic view north to the `Pyrenees mountain range`. From the old town, huge mountains can be easily seen, constantly changing with different weather, like a living thing.

The old city parking is located outside the city center - the `Plaza Mayor` [which is very small], and requires walking through the `Castillo Fortaliza de Aínsa del Siglo XI`, a relatively small castle, which shows two different construction types, from two different eras (11th and 16th centuries), which have resulted in a complex defensive enclosure.

Various military and strategic requirements of each time substantially altered construction techniques and required changes to the building. The engineer Tiburcio Spanochi in the sixteenth century who was in charge of building fortifications along the Aragonese Pyrenees, conceived Aínsa Castle as a unitary enclosure, giving homogeneity and taking advantage of all traces of previous construction phases. Those are now seen as remains of the original medieval fortification built in the eleventh century.

We toured the city, which is small, and as it was late, we checked in at a hotel right in the Plaza Mayor, named `Posada Real`, and were greeted by a Cuban lady living in Aínsa after getting married to a Spaniard. We sat to dine at a restaurant of the same name, located on the opposite side of the plaza. It was chilly outside, and that was perfect. We were able to enjoy the sunset, and see the city fall into darkness.

After dinner, we split into our rooms and prepared for bed. Ilai and I were unable to sleep, and kept thinking about geocache ideas, and had other conversations. We reviewed the caches of Aínsa and decided to try a `Wherigo` cache fo the first time. Sadly, after getting dressed at 2:30 am, and heading to the Castillo, we found out that the cache was in Spanish, and while we were able to guess the answer to the first question, we failed the second. We got back to the hotel, somewhat disappointed, and went to sleep.

## Day 07 - 03/10/'16
*Aínsa &rarr; Vielha &rarr; La Seu d'Urgell*

The next day, we woke up early and got back to the restaurant to get coffee. With dad's help, we were able to translate the question at which we got stuck last night (with the Wherigo cache). Amazingly enough, from here we raced to the end coordinate of the cache even though it was in Spanish, and obtained the key to mark the Wherigo completed. This was fun and revealed us additional parts of the city which we weren't aware of.

After the cache, we headed to `Vielha e Mijaran. After a short drive and a stunning green hilltop drive, we arrived at a relatively new village, where skiers prepare before climbing to the ski sites in the area. Many mountain gear shops were on the main road, and the town looked like it was out taken out of a painting. Modern building, but with affinity to old styles, low houses with coal black roofs. The town was full of blooming flowers, and a lake crossing it was flowing under a bridge on the main route.

We had coffee and proper `Patatas bravas` for the first time in Spain. Patatas bravas, or `patatas a la brava`, is a dish native to Spain, often served in bars. It typically consists of white potatoes that have been cut into irregular shapes of about 2 centimeters, then fried in oil, then served warm with a sauce such as a spicy tomato sauce or an aioli. In here, it was served with both sauces and was excellent.

On from Vielha we continued to La Seu d'Urgell, again driving on the mountainsides, with a great view of steep cliffs and rocks, and vast areas where human foot probably rarely walks. It 's hard to descripbe how fantastic the view in these regions is, at lease to someone who has never experienced such areas and seen those places.

We stopped to refresh at an even smaller village named `Rialp`. I don't know much about the place as we haven't in fact visited there but just stopped for refreshment. Near the road, we walked to the lake of `Noguera Pallaresa, a river flowing from `Era Font d'era Noguereta` at an elevation of about 2,000 meters and merges into the `Segre` river, right just before the `reservoir of Camarasa`. Its waters then flow to the Mediterranean.

We enjoyed the soothing flow, and washed in the soft chilly waters, then continued on our way.

From there, we climbed the mountains yet again, in a road which had multiple observation spots to the enormous mountainsides surrounding the area, and kept on our way to `La Seu d'Urgell`.

La Seu d'Urgell is the capital of the comarca Alt Urgell, head of the judicial district of La Seu d'Urgell and the seat of Bishop of Urgell, one of the Andorra co-princes. Residents of this area regularly drive into Andorra - a ~20 minutes drive - to shop for goods without tax.

The city itself is boring, and for the most part also disgusting. Cow poop is present in the air throughout the day, and the neighborhood in which we slept was dirty and dull.

Ilai and I went out for a quick grab of two caches, one of which was located on a small artificial island inside a local park. We then returned to have our traditional Spain dinner: Jamon, Manchego, baguette, tomatoes and lettuce, and soon after went to sleep.
