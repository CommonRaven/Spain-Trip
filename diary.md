### Day 01 - 27/09/'16
*Tel-Aviv &rarr; Madrid*

* Flight arrived at madrid area too early, so plane circeled around Cuenca. -_-
* Arrived at the apartment (not too small, well equipped kitchen, nice bedrooms) near city center just before midnight, 
* Listened to Vicky Christina Barcelona OST to get in the mood, had a snack, went to sleep. :)
* Amendment: Also banged head real hard against an open window. Bleeded a bit, to really set the mood.

### Day 02 - 28/09/'16
*Madrid*

* Woke up long before the alarm clock.
